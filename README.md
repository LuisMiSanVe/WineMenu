Script Menu that lets you access all Wine's settings and launch pre-installed programs and third-party Wine derivatives.

## 📋 Prerequisites
Obviously, you'll need [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) installed and configured in your system.

The Script also has options to open Wine derivatives or programs that use their unique Wine version such as:
- [Steam (Proton)](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton)
- [Heroic Games Launcher](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)
- [Lutris](https://lutris.net/)
- [PlayOnLinux](https://www.playonlinux.com/)
- [Bottles (Soda)](https://usebottles.com/)

> [!NOTE]
> These programs are optional and they are not required to use the script.

## 📖 About the Project
Aside for the third-party programs, the Script allows you to access the WIne Settings Window and other Windows programs that are installed along with Wine, like `minesweeper`, `notepad` or even the `file explorer`.
